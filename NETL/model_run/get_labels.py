It is the script to generate candidate labels, unsupervised best labels and labels from SVM ranker supervised model. 
Update the parameters in this script. 
Also after you download the files mentioned in readme and if you keep them in different path change it over here.

Parameters:
-cg To generate candiidate labels.
-us To get unsupervised labels.
-s To get supervised labels.
Ideally should first use -cg to get candiate label file before going for unsupervised or supervised model.
But can be used directly if you already have your candidate label file for the topics.
Example for topics given in toy_data/toytopics.csv
